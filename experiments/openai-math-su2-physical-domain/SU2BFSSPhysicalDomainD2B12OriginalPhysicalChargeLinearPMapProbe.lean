# BFSS SU2 D2B12 — actual Mathlib unbounded closed physical charge operator

PROSPECTIVE until the pinned Lean CI and exact #print axioms gate pass.

Upgrade the exact OAI gauge-restricted closed charge graph from D2B11
into Mathlib's genuine *partially defined linear operator* LinearPMap.
This is NOT a newly invented operator: toLinearPMap is applied to the
ACTUAL source graph G.deformedModelGraph 1 0, and its graph is then
proved equal to that same source graph.

Vertical uniqueness was previously proved by original OAI; D2B11
supplies true source Hilbert-space domain density. A genuine closed,
densely defined linear operator follows by these source proofs,
without assuming a Hamiltonian, normalizability, graph core for a
maximal extension, or spectral theorem.

The output space is still the ambient sixteen-component L²; D2A
separately proves all graph outputs are physical. No false assertion
about an unbounded operator acting on the ENTIRE physical Hilbert
space is introduced.
