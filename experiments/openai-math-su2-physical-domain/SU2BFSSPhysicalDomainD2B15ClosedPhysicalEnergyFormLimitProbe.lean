# BFSS SU2 D2B15 — quantitative closed-charge energy and form-domain completeness

PROSPECTIVE until exact pinned Lean Actions compiler and axiom smoke succeeds.

For the actual ORIGINAL GaugeData gauge-restricted closed charge column:
* each sixteen-charge L2 output is bounded by exactly 16 times the
  closed nonnegative q = (1/16) sum ||Qα ψ||²;
* its genuine source graph is complete as a closed subspace of the
  original Hilbert product;
* convergence in the physical L² input and all sixteen charge outputs
  produces an element of the actual operator domain with the
  expected closed output.

Because the charge index is finite, these are the analytic graph
closedness and quantitative energy controls underlying the familiar
closed positive form norm. No form representation theorem, self-adjoint
Hamiltonian, maximal-domain equality, or spectral claim is asserted.
