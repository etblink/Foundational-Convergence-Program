# BFSS SU2 D2B13 — source invariant smooth-core column closes to exact physical column

PROSPECTIVE until pinned compiler and exact permitted-axiom smoke PASS.

This uses Mathlib's actual theory of closed and closable partially-defined
linear operators. The source invariant SmoothCore charge column is a
LinearPMap made from the ORIGINAL SOURCE raw restricted graph,
not a replacement domain. Its operator closure is then identified
with the D2B12 closed densely-defined charge operator.

This justifies "smooth invariant core is a graph-norm core" ONLY for
this specific source MINIMAL CLOSED COLUMN by its definition. It does
NOT prove the minimal graph equals an arbitrary MAXIMAL differential
realization, nor any Hamiltonian essential self-adjointness, bound
states or spectral properties.
