# BFSS SU2 D2B16 — exact source operator rebased to the true physical Hilbert space

PROSPECTIVE until pinned Lean 4.34.1 Gate 63+ checks all axioms.

The previously defined closed joint-charge column has a domain dense
ONLY in source G.physicalSpace, not necessarily in ambient unrestricted
FullL2. Mathlib's unbounded adjoint needs domain density in the
operator's genuine ambient Hilbert space. Therefore DO NOT apply
LinearPMap.adjoint to the ambient-FullL2 operator.

This leaf pulls back the EXACT source G.deformedModelGraph 1 0
under the canonical inclusion of G.physicalSpace in FullL2,
uses the source's proved vertical uniqueness, proves the graph
identity and topological closedness, and proves DENSITY within
the precise source physical Hilbert space at N=2.

The output remains 16 components in ambient FullL2; the established
source theorem shows they are all gauge invariant. No paper
Hamiltonian/operator or spectral identification is claimed.
