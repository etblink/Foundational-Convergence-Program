# BFSS SU2 D2B10A — projected original smooth-core density in physical L2

PROSPECTIVE / UNCOMPILED until exact pinned CI acceptance.

D2B9C proves that the genuine original SU2 Haar projection P is a
bounded linear operator with range exactly GaugeData.physicalSpace,
and fixes every original physical Hilbert vector.

Combined with the original coreToL2_dense theorem, this implies:
  closure { P(coreToL2 f) | f : SmoothCore 2 } = G.physicalSpace.
This is unconditional mathematical progress on the exact source objects.

The subsequent result is EXPLICITLY CONDITIONAL on the still-open
full-Hilbert / smooth-test Haar compatibility identity, and gives
the exact remaining bridge to coreNormClosure = physicalSpace.

The condition is NOT claimed to have been discharged.
No external physics assumption, surrogate core, or axiom is introduced.
