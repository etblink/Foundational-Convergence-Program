# BFSS SU2 D2B8C — unconditional strong continuity of genuine FullL2 gauge action

PROSPECTIVE / UNCOMPILED until the exact pinned Lean CI gate passes.

Use the ORIGINAL source GaugeData.boson group homomorphism, its
actual joint continuity and measure-preserving linear isometries,
and the pinned Mathlib Lp composition-continuity theorem.

D2B8B has already established true-source fermion L2
parameter continuity and conditional full gauge strong continuity.
This leaf discharges that precise bosonic L2 pullback hypothesis.

No substitute gauge action, added GaugeData regularity assumption,
new axiom, or claimed full-Hilbert Haar projection is admitted.
