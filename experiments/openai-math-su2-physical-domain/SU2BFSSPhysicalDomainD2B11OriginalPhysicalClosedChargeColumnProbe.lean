# BFSS SU2 D2B11 — original physical restricted closed charge-column domain

NEW PROSPECTIVE SOURCE-BOUND GATE. No theorem is accepted until
the exact pinned Lean Actions compilation and axiom smoke pass.

This combines the previously qualified:
* exact source-restricted joint-charge graph D1;
* physical inputs/outputs of the restricted graph D2A;
* closed graph vertical uniqueness from pinned OAI ClosedProfiles;
* unconditional source Hilbert-norm physical-core density D2B10C.

The result identifies the genuine original SU2 invariant-core charge
column as a closed, single-valued, densely defined graph over the
source physical Hilbert subspace. The closed graph was already
constructed by the pinned source as a graph closure; the NEW link is
density in the entire true source physical Hilbert space, independently
of any Hamiltonian spectral theorem.

No equality with a MAXIMAL differential-operator realization,
paper self-adjoint Hamiltonian, operator/form graph-norm density
beyond the closure by definition, or spectral prediction is claimed.

/-- The new post-Gate-47 physical-domain theorem: the domain
of the exact original closed gauge-restricted joint supercharge
column is HILBERT-NORM DENSE in the ENTIRE source-defined
physical Hilbert space (and contains only physical states).

This asserts density of the operator's DOMAIN in L², not that
the invariant core is graph-norm dense in a MAXIMAL extension.
