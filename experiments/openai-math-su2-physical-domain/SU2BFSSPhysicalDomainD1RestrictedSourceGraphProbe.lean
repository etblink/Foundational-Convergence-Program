# BFSS SU(2) Physical Domain D1 — exact gauge-restricted source graph

PROSPECTIVE / UNCOMPILED until the dedicated pinned Actions gate succeeds.
This is a bounded bridge between the original gauge-invariant source
smooth core, the original 16-charge column, and the *actual* source
GaugeData.deformedModelGraph (at h=1,m=0).

There is no claim that the physical smooth core is L²-dense in the
entire physicalSpace, that charge images stay in physicalSpace, or
that a paper's self-adjoint Hamiltonian has been identified.
