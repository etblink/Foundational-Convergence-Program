# BFSS Physical Domain D2A — closed joint-charge graph stays physical

PROSPECTIVE / NOT COMPILED until dedicated pinned GitHub Actions gate PASS.
The source physical-space is exactly the BFSS GaugeData.physicalSpace.
The charge-image physical invariance theorem is exactly the Gate-6 D3B
statement, not a new assumption.

D2A proves a closed operator-domain correspondence, NOT density of the
physical smooth core within all source physical L² (future D2B).
