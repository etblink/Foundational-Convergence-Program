# BFSS SU2 D2B14 — exact closed physical charge energy on its true source domain

PROSPECTIVE / UNCOMPILED until the pinned Actions gate succeeds.

The energy is the literal sum of squared norms of the ACTUAL D2B12
closed gauge-restricted source charge operator, at the source 1/16
normalization. It is defined only on that operator's actual domain.

Its restriction to the ORIGINAL invariant SmoothCore agrees exactly
with M.coreForm, and hence with the accepted original massless
deformedCoreEnergy 1 0. This is the necessary initial form-domain
bridge, not yet an associated self-adjoint Hamiltonian theorem.

The source raw-core-to-closed charge graph identity is preserved.
No graph-dominance or maximum differential realization is assumed.
