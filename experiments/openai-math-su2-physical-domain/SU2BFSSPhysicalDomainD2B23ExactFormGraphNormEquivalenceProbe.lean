# BFSS SU2 D2B23 — exact closed Hilbert graph and normalized form norm comparison

PROSPECTIVE until exact pinned Lean 4.34.1 Actions kernel/axioms PASS.

Let T be the true source-derived, closed, densely defined physical
sixteen-component Hilbert charge column. Gate D2B22 already establishes
q(ψ) = (1/16) ‖Tψ‖² and its exact original BFSS source correspondence.

Here the actual Hilbert graph is proved CompleteSpace, and the literal
squared form norm F(ψ) = ‖ψ‖² + q(ψ) is bounded against the
graph squared norm G(ψ) = ‖ψ‖² + ‖Tψ‖²:

  F(ψ) ≤ G(ψ) ≤ 16 F(ψ).

This is the crucial norm-equivalence estimate for the closed form.
Do NOT claim an abstract form-representation theorem or an associated
Hamiltonian operator merely from these estimates.
