# BFSS fermions F3-B4 — 24-mode occupation-label selector on basis vectors

The actual transported occupied / vacant operators are selected according to
one target occupation label. Their product is an explicitly ORDERED recursion
over the full finite mode list; no `Finset.prod` or assumption that arbitrary
continuous linear maps commute is used.

This establishes action on each canonical occupation ket, NOT extraction from
an arbitrary vector, basis completeness or theta_irreducible.
