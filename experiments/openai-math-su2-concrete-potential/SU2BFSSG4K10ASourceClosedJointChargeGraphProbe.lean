# BFSS SU(2) G4-K10A — exact original closed joint-charge graph identity

UNCOMPILED candidate until an independently reported pinned CI gate is green.

This is a bounded source-typed corollary of the kernel-qualified G4-K9D
all-SmoothCore charge identity. It identifies exactly the joint graph closure
the upstream source defines; it does NOT identify the self-adjoint Hamiltonian,
its closed quadratic form or gauge-invariant physical operator domain.
